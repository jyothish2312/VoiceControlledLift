Condo is a modular system which can be applied onto conventional lift systems in a building without much modification. 
It’s a system designed to enable speech-based control and operation of a normal lift system. The system is designed to be very affordable at the same time it’s extremely flexible, it can be set up for a 2 floor building or to a 200 floor building with equal ease.
There are 2 main parts of this system.
1. The electronic control module: contains a speech recognition system and the control unit for the floor selection servo motors. 
2. Floor selection servo mechanism: consists of modular blocks (like Lego) which can be arranged and installed onto an existing control panel of a lift system. These blocks are of two types; one which structural connect other blocks to each other and two the blocks which hold the servo motors for pressing the buttons on already existing lift control panel. 
Provided more access to the lift’s circuitry, we can eliminate altogether the servos and the whole 2nd part of this system, part 1 can be directly wired up to the lift’s system. It should be an easy fix.
